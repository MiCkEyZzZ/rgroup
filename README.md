# The Rick and Morty React App

In May 2021, I accepted a coding challenge to interview for React Developer at Resolventa Groupe.
A text message was sent to me vie email and describe the challenge. In June 2021, I decided to take
on the challenge just for fun. The main goal that motivated me to try to implement this application
using the technologies described below. 

In this App, you can find your favorite character of Rick and Morty. 
You can also learn more about the character and add it to your favorite list. 

**Technologies used**
```
